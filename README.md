# Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning ðŸ“°ðŸ¤–  

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect and classify news articles as **real** or **fake**, leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The implementation was carried out in **Jupyter Notebook**, ensuring detailed analysis and visualization.  

---

## Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, stopword removal, tokenization, and TF-IDF vectorization.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision-Recall scores, Confusion Matrix, and ROC-AUC curves.  

---

## Dataset  
- Contains thousands of news articles labeled as real or fake.  
- Preprocessed for feature extraction using **TF-IDF vectorization**.  

---

## Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries**:  
  - **NLP**: NLTK, Scikit-learn  
  - **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
