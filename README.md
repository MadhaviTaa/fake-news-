Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning and Jupyter

Built a machine learning model to classify news articles as real or fake, leveraging powerful tools and algorithms. The project was implemented in Jupyter Notebook for seamless analysis and visualization. Key highlights include:

Dataset: Processed a dataset containing thousands of news articles with labeled classes (real/fake).
Preprocessing: Cleaned text data, removed stopwords, performed tokenization, and applied TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.
Algorithms Used: Trained and evaluated models using Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
Model Performance: Achieved an accuracy of >90% and high precision-recall scores through parameter tuning.
Evaluation: Utilized confusion matrices, ROC-AUC curves, and classification reports to assess the model.
The project demonstrated expertise in Python, Scikit-learn, NLP techniques, and data visualization, solving a crucial societal challenge of misinformation detection.
